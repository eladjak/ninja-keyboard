## Status: Active
## Last Updated: 2026-04-01
## Sprint: Iteration 17 — Art Completion + Game-Feel Effects

## Current State
Iteration 17 COMPLETE. 36 hero images (25 base + 11 alternate forms). ALL 11 badges. 3 new game-feel components. Multiple V2/V3 redesigns per feedback. Ki's dad renamed Raz→Alon. TypeScript: 0 errors, Tests: 1144/1144. Commits: 00326d8, d039edb, b8ea23d, c32cfcd, 4e54f40, 6002749, ebbf4a8, b5ba36e.

## EXACT CONTINUATION PLAN (for next session)
### ART ROUND 3 (Apr 3, 2026)
- ✅ Rex V3: GREEN color + gamer elements (headset, controller) + creative (beret, paintbrush)
- ✅ Shadow combat mode: hood + face mask, dual daggers, fighting stance
- ✅ Keres+Virus mega boss V2: MUCH bigger, muscular, intimidating
- ✅ Barak V2: with pants matching Storm's outfit
- ✅ Alon hero (Ki's dad): first image — ninja-coder, golden pendant, digital gloves
- ✅ Shir hero (Ki's mom): first image — warm Israeli mom, braid, reading glasses, pendant
- ✅ Gallery corrections noted: Phantom→mentor is Sensei Zen (not Mika!), Sakura→mentor for Yuki AND other girls
- Future: battle poses for all characters in expression sheets

### ART ROUND 2 — ALL DONE
- ✅ Ki's dad RENAMED: Raz → Alon (אלון) in visual bible. Phantom stays separate.
- ✅ Phantom 2 versions: with cloak + without cloak (revealed face)
- ✅ Pixel V3: more robotic while staying feminine
- ✅ Rex V2: slightly more mature
- ✅ Block V3: gray concrete + orange, more threatening
- ✅ Glitch 5 forms: confused → current → corrupted → shattered → whole
- ✅ Keres+Virus fusion: bug king merged with virus power
- ✅ Virus ancient form: primordial enemy of Master Beat
- ✅ Blaze V2: APPROVED, kept as is

### NEXT PRIORITY
8. Chrome review remaining 15 pages
9. Voice generation: 9 characters (ElevenLabs)
10. Theme songs: 8+ characters (Suno V5)
11. Jukebox cover art
12. Teacher/parent dashboard
13. 3D POC: Ki model (React Three Fiber, files started)
14. More game-feel: power-up visuals

## KEY RULES (from user feedback)
- ALL character art MUST be CHIBI style (big head, small body, kid-friendly)
- Pixel V3 was great (keep personality), Mika V3 has tech elements (keep)
- Story dialog should sound like natural Israeli Hebrew (slang, unique voices)
- App must FEEL like a real game (particles, combos, celebrations)
- User reviews MUST be HTML in browser (never terminal text)
- Follow iteration protocol: read context → work → verify → document → review
